C is a low-level (but once regarded high level) systems programming language. The C language gives you complete control over the memory space of your process, and ability to write complex control structures to work with that memory, and access to the kernel API for the system you're on.

C is hard.
But, C also gives you the ability to shoot yourself in the foot. When you make a mess, you need to clean it up. C doesn't make any assumptions for you, if you say you know what you're doing... then thats it. The C language will let you keep going. If you malloc from the heap, you better free it. If you create a buffer for user memory, you better hope the data is the right size.

... so why bother?
While learning C is difficult, the language will make it easier to learn other languages. Having an understand at such a low level of how the computer works will make learning other languages like Python and Javascript SO much easier.
